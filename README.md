# PS Blog

A sample Django Project to implement a blog backend server.

I tried to use many Django and DRF functionalities.

Even though I normally prefer multiple smaller apps with specific
roles over one complex -can do everything- app, I only used one app
to keep everything close together. For example all the models are 
in `blog/models.py` file and all views are in the `blog/views` module
